# Description:
# This is the main control file for Troll Riddle Race.
# It manages player input, turn logic, and win/loss outcomes using recursion,
# 2D grid navigation, and modular code from board and riddles modules.

from board import Board
from riddles import ask_riddle

def play_game():
    """
    This function starts and runs the main game loop.

    How the game works:
    - The player and troll begin at random locations on a grid.
    - Each turn presents a riddle to the player.
        ‚Ä¢ If answered correctly, the player chooses a direction to move.
        ‚Ä¢ If answered incorrectly, the troll moves.
    - The game ends when either:
        ‚Ä¢ The player reaches the treasure (win)
        ‚Ä¢ The troll reaches the player (loss)

    This function demonstrates:
    - Recursive question handling (via ask_riddle)
    - Modular logic separation (via Board class)
    - Grid-based movement using 2D position tracking
