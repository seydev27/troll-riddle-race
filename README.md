# 🧌 Troll Riddle Race

**Troll Riddle Race** is a modular, Python-based puzzle game I created where you race a troll across a grid — **one riddle at a time**.

Designed to reinforce core Python skills I'm learning in my college CS courses, including recursion, logic, and modular programming — with a twist of using a custom riddle library.

## 🎯 Project Goal

Troll Riddle Race is a modular, Python-based game designed to reinforce core computer science concepts through creative gameplay.

This project helps practice:

- 🧠 **Logic & problem solving** via riddle-based progression  
- 🔁 **Recursion**, especially in the final multi-attempt riddle mechanic  
- 🗺️ **Grid navigation** and state tracking using 2D coordinates  
- 📦 **Basic use of Python libraries**, such as `colorama` for UI enhancement  
- 📁 **Clean, modular design**, with reusable components and functions

## 🧠 How to Play

1. Choose a direction to move (N/E/S/W)
2. Solve the riddle to advance
3. If you're wrong, the troll moves instead
4. Reach the treasure before the troll
5. Once there, you'll have 3 tries per turn to solve the final puzzle and WIN!
6. But if the troll arrives while you're stuck...
   YOU LOSE — GAME OVER!
